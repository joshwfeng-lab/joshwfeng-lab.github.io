I am a PhD candidate in sociocultural anthropology at UC Berkeley. My research examines luxury fruit markets in Japan, with a focus on Miyazaki mangoes, regional branding, and tropicality.

I am interested in media, logistics, and how ideas of place circulate through food, tourism, and infrastructure.
